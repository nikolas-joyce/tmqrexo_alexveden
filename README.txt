This is a PyCharm 5 project with GIT repository inside, you can download Community edition of PyCharm for free
(https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows). But PyCharm is not required, for this code execution,
you can run it into a browser or in command line.

HOW TO INSTALL AND RUN
----------------------

1.	Download Anaconda Python for windows (https://www.continuum.io/downloads). I’m using Python 3.4, but actual version
    is 3.5, but I think they are fully compatible.

2.	Run cmd file ‘run_notebook.cmd’, afterwards  http://localhost:8888/tree will be opened in your browser.
